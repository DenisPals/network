# Network - A social network where users can follow and like other users posts
## Complexity:
 This web application is a social network in a simplified form. The user can post and like posts. Additionally the user can follow other users. 
 This was a course project for Harvards CS50s Web Programming with Python and JavaScript.

Some of the greater challenges were:
* JavaScript like update using AJAX.
* Integration of Bootstraps Pagination feature.
* The architecture required for a single-page application. 

## Files

**views.py** &rarr; contains the route functions for the web application. Bootstraps pagination feature is implemented here and returns the posts as JSON. 

**project.js** &rarr; contains the javaScript for the project and generates a fair amount of html. This is a single-page application.


## How to run
The web application can be viewed [here](https://networkdp.herokuapp.com/). Feel free to sign up using fake credentials, you won't receive any emails.
